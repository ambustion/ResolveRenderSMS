 Script to send a text message when rendering is finished

Download both the .py file and the .ini file to your delivery scripts folder: on Windows - C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Deliver

On first run you will get a popup to enter in your phone number, email information and phone carrier. I collect nothing here and have only obscured the pw very mildly so suggest using a gmail account just for this. 

Then just trigger the script on start of render. It will keep an eye on your render and as it finishes will send a text message(hopefully).

Carriers are listed in the .ini file so just add yours if it isn't listed.
